# Console-SplooshKaboom 🦑

### 🗺️ Overview

This project is an unofficial, single-player, console-based version of Battleships inspired by the squid hunt minigame in *The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker*. The game is currently in an unstable, "bare bones" state and will be expanded over time with new features and improvements.


### 🌱 Objective

The main objective of this project is to help me grow as a C# developer. I’m learning project management on GitHub alongside developing software with the .NET framework. I aim to improve both the quality of the code and the organisation of the project as my knowledge in both areas continues to grow.
